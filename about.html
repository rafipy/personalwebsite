                        Born and raised in Bali, I'm just your average 17 year old who loves games a little bit too much,
                        loves not thinking a bit too much,
                        and who loves reading some good stories that will give me the best tear-jerker in my goddamn life.

                        There has been nothing that I could call home as much as a nice computer does,
                        since a very young age I hated math and wanted to hop on roblox 24/7.
        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        I was a kid, don't judge me. 
        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Anyways, hated math, but after going through what can only be described as an anime training arc by one of 
                        my teachers, who has sadly passed away, I was taught the joys of math and physics. Learnt that its not just about counting numbers,
                        its about following logic and solving problems through that line of logic. Math was like a tattered map and the numbers and variables
                        just served as legends that need to be placed together to get the treasure.
        
                        <br>
                        <br>
        
                        Goodness, that is an extremely corny way of describing that. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anyways... that's why I'm here now doing some computer science.

                Specifically single player games. There was a time where I played multiplayer games and I played them 
                extremely competitively. I remember the nights when I stayed up playing Rainbow Six Siege with my folks all the way
                till 4 am. They were NOT HEALTHY. 

                <br>
                <br>

                And I only found this out when I binged out singleplayer games like Dark Souls 3, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Armored Core, 
                Monster Hunter, Visual Novels, OneShot, Omori. After going through all those did I finally find INNER PEACE and saw
                games for what they truly are.

        <div class="accordion-body">
          For music the main thing I use here is <strong>FL Studio</strong>, yes its extremely normie, yes you can call me a scrub but I've used the damn thing for a solid 4 years now and I'm now exactly keen to swap from home sweet home. I've tried experimenting here and there with Ableton and Studio One but my monkey brain couldn't exactly comprehend that <em>sigh</em>. For plugins my personal favourites is Guitar Rig Pro 7, Vocaloid, ValhallaSupermassive and Addictive Keys! Though I find myself gravitating to the basic plugins FL Studio offers, there's just more creativity in a limited arsenal, yknow?</div>

            Long have I realized that my personal favourite genre is <strong>Cyberpunk</strong>, I've always been a fan of the genre and the aesthetic it brings. The neon lights, the dark alleyways, the rain, lord especially the rain. Other than that I find the bleak message that it portrays, mainly the privatisation of everything just such a terrifying concept and a realistic one too given how questionable these huge corporations have been as of late. It just <em>hits different</em>. 
            <br><br>Though I'd say a close second would be <strong>Slice of Life's</strong> due to the amount VNs I read.

      <div id="inspiration" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
        <div class="accordion-body">
          There's a long and exhaustive list of inspirations that I have. I think that my current main ones have to be <strong>ZUN</strong>, creator of the <strong>Touhou Project</strong> series, he's always been the one who got me into game dev in the first place. His music just captured something in me and his character designs are marvelous despite his <em>questionable</em> artstyle. 
          <br><br>Another one I'd attribute greatly would be <strong>Jun Maeda</strong> and the rest of <strong>KEY</strong>, they're a Visual Novel compay and I have never cried or learnt so much about the power of stories in games until I read their works. 
          <br><br>Finally I'd say <strong>Arknights</strong> as a series gave me how valuable world-building is. I've always been one for Gacha Games but never has a Gacha Game so enraputred me in its lore as much as Arknights has, mainly just because of how bleak and detailed it gets.
