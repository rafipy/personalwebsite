                        Born and raised in Bali, I'm just your average 17 year old who loves games a little bit too much,
                        loves not thinking a bit too much,
                        and who loves reading some good stories that will give me the best tear-jerker in my goddamn life.

                        <br>
                        
                        There has been nothing that I could call home as much as a nice computer does,
                        since a very young age I hated math and wanted to hop on roblox 24/7.
        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        I was a kid, don't judge me. 
        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Anyways, hated math, but after going through what can only be described as an anime training arc by one of 
                        my teachers, who has sadly passed away, I was taught the joys of math and physics. Learnt that its not just about counting numbers,
                        its about following logic and solving problems through that line of logic. Math was like a tattered map and the numbers and variables
                        just served as legends that need to be placed together to get the treasure.
        
                        <br>
                        <br>
        
                        Goodness, that is an extremely corny way of describing that. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Anyways... that's why I'm here now doing some computer science.

                Specifically single player games. There was a time where I played multiplayer games and I played them 
                extremely competitively. I remember the nights when I stayed up playing Rainbow Six Siege with my folks all the way
                till 4 am. They were NOT HEALTHY. 

                <br>
                <br>

                And I only found this out when I binged out singleplayer games like Dark Souls 3, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Armored Core, 
                Monster Hunter, Visual Novels, OneShot, Omori. After going through all those did I finally find INNER PEACE and saw
                games for what they truly are.
